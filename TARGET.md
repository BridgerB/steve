# Minecraft Bot Challenge Requirements

If you want to prove that they can beat the game, you have to record it and
publish it somewhere.

## Rules

- No cuts
- No teleporting
- No prompting
- No human input at all except at the very beginning

In speedrunner terms, we want a **random seed any% glitchless speedrun**,
although speed is not really the point. General reliability is the point.

## Goal

The bot could start in any world and reliably do the same things that human
players need to do to beat the game. Minimizing play time is good, but
optimizing too much for speed can lead to some very gimmicky tricks that aren't
very general.

Our ultimate goal here is not just to beat the game as fast as possible, but to
**build reliable, capable, clever bots that can do anything that humans can
do**.

## Implementation Flexibility

You can make a pure mineflayer bot to do any of these chunks or beat the entire
game. I think that would be **awesome. And ideally, it would still improve the
fundamental systems of mineflayer and indirectly improve the Minecraft bots,
too.**
